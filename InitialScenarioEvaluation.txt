Initial Scenario Evaluation Document for web assignment

CarZone Ltd specializes in the maintenance of cars ranging from conventional models to fairly recent introductions to the
market including hybrid and electric. The company currently has no online presence, however, we have been informed that they
have recently implemented a computerized database to better keep track of their clients, suppliers and inventory. With a growing demand for their
services, the owner of the company aims to expand his business and  wishes for us to develop a company website to kickstart 
his e-marketing campaign as well as improving the relationship CarZone Ltd holds with its clients.
